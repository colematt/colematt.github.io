\par \begin{list1}
	\item Repurposed Intel Memory Protection Extensions for generalized storage, and implemented analyses for the LLVM compiler toolchain to replace memory accesses with these inlined register operations.
	\item Engineered an implementation of the RISC-V architecture employing inline code tagging for integrity models from compiler-driven static program analysis techniques, using the LLVM compiler toolchain.
	\item Extended our implementation of the RISC-V architecture and LLVM compiler toolchain to perform out-of-band data tagging, with the ability to achieve relaxation and linkage resolution at link-time using a modified version of the LLD linker.
	\item Developed a prototype extending data tagging for a read- and write-limited data model that specifically enforces compile-time \texttt{const} qualifiers as run-time assurances.
	\item Developed a technique for extracting design patterns from C++ source code and encoding as a finite state machine with an XML machine-readable representation.
	\item Researched scientific utilization of performance benchmark tools for the computer security domain.
